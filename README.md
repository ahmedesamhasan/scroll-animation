Scroll Animation Project
This project demonstrates a simple scroll-triggered animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As the user scrolls down the page, content boxes slide in from the left or right, creating a smooth and visually appealing effect.

Features:
Smooth scroll-triggered animations: Content boxes slide in from the sides as they appear in the viewport.
Responsive layout: The design adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across devices.
Minimal and clean code: Easy to understand and extend for future enhancements.
How it works:
The JavaScript listens for the scroll event and calculates the position of each .box element.
When a box enters the visible area (determined by a threshold), a CSS class is added to trigger the animation, bringing the box into view.
